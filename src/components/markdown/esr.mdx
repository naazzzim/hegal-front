![analysis](/blog/esr/1.png)

As part of the UAE’s commitment as a member of the OECD Framework and in response to an assessment of the UAE’s tax framework by the European Union (EU) Code of Conduct Group on Business Taxation, the UAE MoF issued a Cabinet Resolution on the Economic Substance (‘the Regulations’) on 30 April 2019 for which an Amended Resolution has recently been issued in August 2020 along with Updated Guidance. Economic Substance Regulations (ESR) states that every prescribed entity (‘Licensee’) that carries on Relevant Activities and derives an income from prescribed activities in the UAE are required to perform an Economic Substance Test. There are also certain exemptions prescribed.

If the Relevant UAE authorities determine that the Economic Substance Tests described above have not been met for a financial period, financial penalties could arise. Failure by an entity to comply with the Regulations shall result in penalties amounting from AED 10,000 to AED 400,000.

Economic Substance Test Declaration (filing a Report) must be submitted within 12 months from the end of their financial year (e.g. Report to be submitted by 31 December 2020 for entities with a financial year ending 31 December 2019). Further, Licensees also need to file a notification within 6 months of the close of its FY.

## Ways of Filing ESR Notifications and Report
The primary purpose of ESR is to establish, maintain and illustrate the presence of onshore and free zone companies which undertakes the respective Core Income Generating Activities with regard to meeting the Economic Substance Test.

## ESR Notification Filing
In accordance with the **Economic Substance Regulations**, ESR filing UAE requires the Licensees and Exempted Licensees to file a Notification to their respective Regulatory Authorities for the relevant Financial Year in which the business carries the relevant Core Income Generating Activity. For ESR Notification Filing they are required to submit:

- The nature of respective Core Income Generating Activity being carried out by the Licensee or Exempted Licensee.
- The gross income of the Businesses is carried out under Core Income Generating Activity.
- The end date of the financial year of the Relevant Activity.
- The supporting documents are to provide additional evidence as required by the Regulatory Authorities.

Exempted Licensees are also compelled to file the ESR Notification and along with that, submit supporting documents in order to qualify their exemption.

Exempted Licensees that are tax residents in a jurisdiction outside the United Arab Emirates should submit the following documents:

- Businesses that are tax residents outside the UAE are required to issue a letter or a certificate which affirms their taxability in the foreign jurisdiction. 
- An assessment of business tax, a business tax demand, proof of payment of the business tax, or any additional supporting document, issued by the business that is located in a foreign jurisdiction in which the business claims to be a tax tenant.

However, when a business is unable to provide adequate evidence in order to verify its exemption position, the Regulatory Authorities change the status of the business and repute them as a Licensee.

The time period for the submission of notification is different from that of an Economic Substance Report. The Ministry of Finance Portal is used for ESR Notification Filing which is done within the period of six months from the end of the relevant Financial Year. Also, the Licensees who have submitted an ESR Notification directly to their respective Regulatory Authorities should re-submit a Notification electronically on the Ministry of Finance Portal once available.
