You will be required to file VAT returns once every three months as a minimum. However, in some cases, businesses may be required to file VAT returns monthly. VAT return filing period will be mentioned on your VAT certificate. All the businesses which are registered under VAT must complete the VAT return filing within the time frame given by the Federal Tax Authority (FTA).

## VAT REFUND

Input VAT is the tax payable for items (goods and services) purchased by a business or taxable person in UAE. On the other hand, output VAT is collected tax on items sold by a business or taxable person in UAE.

VAT Voluntary Disclosure form is provided by the FTA to the taxpayer who wants to notify the FTA of an error or omission in a tax return or tax refund application. VAT voluntary disclosure form requires a very keen consideration and it may well be worth-while obtaining professional advice from a registered tax consultant before making any voluntary disclosures so that the potential flow-on consequences can be considered and addressed.

VAT reconsideration allows a taxable person to appeal for the review of the decision made by FTA. All the companies in UAE must be aware of the tax laws to run their businesses smoothly. Any business or a person who received a penalty from FTA can apply for VAT reconsideration in UAE within 20 business days after receiving the penalty. The authority will review the decision and might waive off the penalties if the business proves the case.
## VAT DE-REGISTRATION (VAT NUMBER CANCELLATION)
It is common for businesses to de-register for VAT with the UAE Federal Tax Authority, also known as cancelation or termination of VAT registration. Only the FTA can approve a VAT deregistration in the UAE if the reasons for termination are valid and the necessary conditions are met.
